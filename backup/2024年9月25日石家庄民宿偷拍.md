2024年9月15日，在河北石家庄，视频博主“影子”通过技术手段，查找安装在民宿中的偷拍设备。这些设备会严重侵犯住客的个人隐私。当影子找到安装偷拍设备的民宿后，立刻报警。当地派出所的周警官很快到达现场，并通知民宿老板前来调查。让人意外的是，民宿老板在周警官面前无意中透露，偷拍设备竟然连着他的手机。发现说漏嘴后，他马上编造谎言搪塞过去。我们推断，这些偷拍设备很有可能是民宿老板亲自安装的。不过，警察的警情通报中，并没有提到对该民宿老板的拘留。
影子告诉警察，民宿周边可能还有更多的偷拍设备，等找到后会再通知周警官协助处理。之后，当影子找到了另一个安装偷拍设备的房间，打电话通知周警官时，周警官却没有及时赶到现场。相反，几位神秘人出现了，对影子及其同伴进行殴打和辱骂。我们有理由相信，这伙人可能是警察提前通知过来的。经过调查，这些神秘人是民宿老板的手下。
作为人民警察，理应秉公执法，但却有人透漏消息，帮助这些黑恶势力来恐吓、围堵正义感十足的博主。这个派出所的行为实在令人愤慨。
黑恶势力的犯罪行为屡屡得逞，背后少不了某些官员的庇护。要彻底铲除黑恶势力，关键在于政府。政府必须严格遵守宪法赋予公民的权利，允许公民发声，允许公民批评和监督政府。同时，政府应及时清理那些不合民意的官员。如果公民只因为批评几句，就被删评论、被“请喝茶”或被关进小黑屋，那这样的行为和黑恶势力有什么区别？
在这个社会中，普通民众的力量最为微弱。他们要工作，做生意，挣钱养家，给国家缴税，还要教育子女成为好人，为国家培养人才。如果政府不能维护社会的公正与正义，而是让黑恶势力横行，大家只会向这些势力靠拢。
正如毛主席曾经说过：“我们的一些一把手书记，对于工作中的缺点错误，应该担起责任。不负责任，怕负责任，不许人讲话，老虎屁股摸不得。凡是采取这种态度的人，十个有十个会失败。人总是要讲话的，你老虎屁股是摸不得吗？偏要摸！”


On September 15, 2024, in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, a video blogger known as “影子” used technical means to locate hidden surveillance devices installed in a guesthouse. These devices severely infringe on the personal privacy of guests. After 影子 found the guesthouse with the hidden cameras, he immediately called the police. Officer Zhou from the local police station arrived at the scene and notified the guesthouse owner to come for an investigation. Surprisingly, the guesthouse owner accidentally revealed in front of Officer Zhou that the surveillance devices were connected to his phone. Realizing he had misspoken, he quickly made up a lie to cover it up. We infer that the guesthouse owner likely installed the devices himself, but the police report did not mention any arrest of the owner responsible for the cameras.
影子 told the police that there might be more hidden surveillance devices around the guesthouse, and he would notify Officer Zhou again once they were found. Later, when 影子 located another room with surveillance equipment and called Officer Zhou, the officer did not arrive promptly. Instead, several mysterious individuals showed up and physically assaulted and verbally abused 影子 and his companions. We have reason to believe that these people were tipped off by the police. Upon further investigation, it was found that these individuals were connected to the guesthouse owner.
As public servants, the police should uphold justice, yet it appears someone leaked information to help these criminal elements intimidate and suppress a justice-seeking blogger. This behavior by the police station is utterly disgraceful.
The rampant crimes of criminal organizations are often closely linked to protection from certain officials. To eradicate these criminal forces, the government plays a crucial role. It must strictly adhere to the constitutional rights granted to citizens—allowing them to speak, criticize, and supervise the government. In doing so, the government should swiftly remove officials who do not align with the public interest. If citizens are silenced, their comments deleted, invited for "tea," or even detained in small dark rooms just for criticizing the government, then how is that different from the behavior of criminal organizations?
In this society, ordinary citizens are the weakest. They work, run small businesses, earn money to support their families, contribute taxes to the country, and educate their children to be good people who will become the nation’s talent. If the government cannot maintain fairness and justice in society but instead allows criminal forces to dominate, everyone will begin to follow and align with such criminal organizations.
As Chairman Mao once said: "Some of our first-secretary officials should take responsibility for the shortcomings and mistakes in their work. Avoiding responsibility, fearing accountability, and refusing to allow people to speak are behaviors that will only lead to failure. There will always be people who want to speak. You think your ‘tiger’s backside’ can’t be touched? It must be touched!"
